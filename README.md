A fun Android game where you control a cow trying to collect coins while avoiding mischievous cowgirls!

## Features

- üéÆ Two control modes:
  - Button controls (tap left/right)
  - Tilt controls using device sensors
- üí∞ Coin collection system for scoring
- ü§† Dodge cowgirls to stay alive
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Lives system with visual heart indicators
- üèÜ High score system with location tracking
- üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps integration to view score locations
- üîä Sound effects for coin collection and collisions
- üí´ Rich game feedback:
  - Vibration on collisions
  - Toast notifications for game events
- üéöÔ∏è Two difficulty levels:
  - Easy mode: Slower gameplay
  - Hard mode: Faster gameplay with increased challenge

## Game Controls

### Button Mode
- Tap left button to move cow left
- Tap right button to move cow right

### Tilt Mode
- Tilt device left to move cow left
- Tilt device right to move cow right
- Tilt forward/backward to adjust game speed

## Gameplay Mechanics

- The cow starts with 3 lives (displayed as hearts)
- Collect coins to increase your score
- Avoid cowgirls - collision results in life loss
- Game ends when all lives are lost

### High Score System

The game features a sophisticated high score tracking system that combines a traditional scoreboard with location-based features:

#### Score List View
- Displays top 10 highest scores
- Shows score value, date, and location for each entry
- Scores are automatically sorted from highest to lowest
- Click on location to see it on the map

#### Interactive Map View
- Google Maps integration showing score locations
- Markers for each high score position
- Click markers to see score details
- Automatic zoom to selected score location
- Smooth camera animations when navigating

#### Location Features
- Each score is saved with precise GPS coordinates
- Locations are stored using latitude and longitude
- Uses Google Play Services for accurate positioning
- Interactive integration between list and map views

## Architecture
